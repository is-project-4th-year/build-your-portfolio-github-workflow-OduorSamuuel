## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**



 **1. Concept: Branching**
`Expectation ðŸ‘€:` I thought branching was just something advanced developers used, and didnâ€™t expect to need it for personal projects.

`Reality ðŸ˜…:` I realized how essential branching is, even for solo projects. It allowed me to work on features like the navigation bar or footer separately without messing up the main site.

`Impact ðŸ’¡:` It made my development more organized and safer. I could test new features on a branch and only merge them when I was sure they worked.

**2. Concept: Pull Requests**
`Expectation ðŸ‘€:` I assumed pull requests were only for team projects, like in open source collaborations.

`eality ðŸ˜…:` Even in solo work, pull requests helped me track what changes I was about to make and gave me a chance to review my own work before merging.

`Impact ðŸ’¡:` Using pull requests helped me think more critically about the changes I was making. It also created a better history for my portfolio development process.

**3. Concept: Issues and Milestones**
`Expectation ðŸ‘€:` I honestly thought issues were only for bugs in big apps, and milestones were just "extra."

`Reality ðŸ˜…:` I learned that issues helped break my work into smaller, manageable tasks like "Add Hero Section" or "Fix navbar responsiveness," and milestones helped me organize them into phases.

`Impact ðŸ’¡:` It improved my productivity and planning. I no longer felt overwhelmed by the project because everything was clearly mapped out.

**4. Concept: Merge Conflicts**
`Expectation ðŸ‘€:` I was afraid of merge conflicts and thought they were extremely complex and only happened in huge codebases.

`Reality ðŸ˜…:` I encountered a merge conflict when working between my main and about-section branches, and while it was intimidating at first, I learned how to resolve it in VS Code and commit the fix.

`Impact ðŸ’¡:` Now I understand what causes conflicts and how to approach them calmly. It's no longer something I fear, and I can even help others debug it.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Below are screenshots demonstrating how I effectively used various GitHub features to manage my portfolio project development process.

### A. Milestones and Issues
![Milestones and Issues Overview](https://is-project-4th-year.github.io/build-your-portfolio-github-workflow-OduorSamuuel/images/milestone.png)
*This screenshot shows my project milestone . I created specific issues for different components like "Create Hero Section," "Implement Experience section," and "Add footer section." This helped me break down the portfolio development into manageable tasks and track progress systematically.*

### B. Project Board
![GitHub Project Board](https://is-project-4th-year.github.io/build-your-portfolio-github-workflow-OduorSamuuel/images/project%20board.png)
*My GitHub Project Board organized using a Kanban-style layout with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This visual workflow helped me track which features I was working on and provided a clear overview of my project's progress. Issues automatically moved between columns as I updated their status.*

### C. Branching Strategy
![Branch Management](https://is-project-4th-year.github.io/build-your-portfolio-github-workflow-OduorSamuuel/images/branch1.png)
*Screenshot displaying my branching strategy with meaningful branch names like "feature/hero-section," "feature/about-page," and "fix/navbar-responsiveness." Each branch was created for specific features or bug fixes, allowing me to work on different parts of the portfolio without affecting the main codebase.*

### D. Pull Requests
![Pull Request Example](https://is-project-4th-year.github.io/build-your-portfolio-github-workflow-OduorSamuuel/images/pull%20request.png)
*This pull request shows the merge of my "feature/3-add-about-technologies-and-portfolio-sections" branch into main. The PR includes a detailed description of changes made, links to the related issue (#5), and shows the code review process. This approach ensured quality control and maintained a clean commit history.*

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution

*For the personal portfolio, I didn't encounter merge conflict as the way I encoountered when working on the teams portfolio work. However if I could encounter I would open pull the latest changes on my code editor and then attempt to merge to the main branch, then it will show the conflict and then I resolve them using the editor by accepting both changes or current incoming change after comparing the incoming and the current change. After that I check the stracture after resolving the change for any issue and then commit,push and then merge to the main branch.*

## How I Used GitHub Project Management Features

**Project Board Implementation:**
I utilized GitHub's built-in project board to create a streamlined workflow for my portfolio development. The board was structured with three main columns:
- **To Do**: New issues and planned features
- **In Progress**: Currently active tasks
- **Done**: Completed features and resolved issues

**Issue Tracking:**
Each major component of my portfolio became an individual issue with:
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Detailed descriptions of what needed to be accomplished
- Appropriate labels (e.g., "enhancement," "bug," "documentation")
- Assignment to relevant milestones

**Branching Workflow:**
I followed a feature-branch workflow where:
- Main branch remained stable and deployable
- Each new feature or fix was developed in its own branch
- Branch names followed a consistent naming convention (feature/name or fix/name)
- All changes were integrated through pull requests

**Milestone Organization:**
I created milestones to group related issues and track major phases of development:
- "Portfolio Foundation" - Basic structure and layout
- "Content Development" - Adding actual portfolio content
- "Polish & Deploy" - Final styling and deployment preparation
